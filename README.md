# Simple Work Day Planner

## Description

This is a worday planner that allows for simple task managment. It was designed to test my knoweldge of day.js, as well as provide an ecofriendly way of managing my tasks at work. Before creating this app I would keep track of what I had to do at work through sticky notes and a planner, That was not only clutter indusing but also required me to carry a lot of extra weight to and from work. This app helped me learn how to access and recall things from local storage as well as the very useful API of Day.js

The scheduler is color coded so that the past times are in grey, the present is in red, and the future is in green.
